# 🛠️ Titanic Survival Prediction with Astro Airflow, Redis, Prometheus & Grafana

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline using **Astro Airflow**, **Redis feature store**, **SQL**, and **ML Monitoring** via **Prometheus and Grafana**, designed to predict Titanic passenger survival.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack data engineering and machine learning system using the Titanic dataset. It covers:

- ETL pipeline orchestration using **Astro Airflow**
- Feature storage and retrieval using **Redis**
- Drift detection using **Alibi Detect**
- ML monitoring and dashboards via **Prometheus + Grafana**
- Model serving via a **Flask web app**

## 🛠️ Key Features

### ✅ ETL with Astro Airflow
- Simple setup using `astro dev init`
- Loads CSV data from GCP bucket into PostgreSQL
- Transforms and formats CSV into SQL-compatible structure

### ✅ Feature Store with Redis
- Fast, scalable alternative to storing features with `.pkl` files
- Optimized for high-speed retrieval and dynamic scaling
- Methods implemented for storing, extracting, and updating features

### ✅ Drift Detection
- Implemented **Alibi Detect** for:
  - **Data drift**: change in input features (X)
  - **Concept drift**: change in relationship between inputs and outputs (X → Y)
- Uses reference (training) vs current (live/testing) data
- Custom drift metrics tracked via Prometheus

### ✅ Model Training Pipeline
- Combines ingestion → processing → training into a unified flow
- Extracts clean features from Redis
- Trains and validates ML model (Titanic survival prediction)

### ✅ Real-Time Predictions with Flask App
- Frontend built with HTML
- Accepts user inputs and returns survival predictions
- Hooks into Redis to access clean features for inference

### ✅ Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana
- **Prometheus**:
  - Tracks custom metrics (e.g., drift count, prediction count)
  - Provides default system metrics (HTTP traffic, uptime, etc.)
- **Grafana**:
  - Visualizes metrics with dashboards
  - Triggers alerts (e.g., drift count > threshold)

## 🧪 Data Source

- Dataset: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Format: CSV
- Stored in GCP Bucket and later ingested into PostgreSQL

## 💡 Why Use Redis as a Feature Store?

| Traditional (joblib/pickle) | Redis Feature Store |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Slower for large datasets   | High-speed retrieval |
| Not scalable                | Easily scalable      |
| Manual reprocessing needed  | Efficient updates    |


## 🧭 Future Enhancements

- Integrate Kafka for real-time streaming
- Migrate from Redis to **Feast** for advanced feature store management
- Deploy to GCP and enable cloud-based monitoring
- Add authentication layer to Flask app
